PREFACE
</h2>
<p>
So long as there shall exist, by virtue of law and custom, decrees of
damnation pronounced by society, artificially creating hells amid the
civilization of earth, and adding the element of human fate to divine
destiny; so long as the three great problems of the century—the
degradation of man through pauperism, the corruption of woman through
hunger, the crippling of children through lack of light—are
unsolved; so long as social asphyxia is possible in any part of the world;—in
other words, and with a still wider significance, so long as ignorance and
poverty exist on earth, books of the nature of Les Misérables cannot fail
to be of use.
